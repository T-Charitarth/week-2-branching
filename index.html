                    The College has a Centre for Student Services and Placement, which gives personal and career counseling to the students. The idea is to enable<br> students to effectively cope with life at College as well as in their career. One of the major objectives of the centre is to help students in <br>obtaining internships and placements in reputed companies across various industrial sectors. Assistance is also provided <br>to students in procuring higher education opportunities. The College offers special coaching for GATE, TOEFL, <br>and GRE to its students. They are also encouraged to present technical papers at seminars in other colleges with a view to improving <br>their research and presentation skills. Also, during the last few years, several personality development programs have been <br>conducted by experts from industry.
